<h1>DokuWiki Downloader</h1>
<p>
    This script will download <strong>DokuWiki $TAG</strong> to your webserver
    and install it in <strong>$DIR</strong>. That directory currently contains the following files:
</p>

<pre>$FILES</pre>

<p>
    You probably want to install into an empty directory. The script may overwrite any existing file!
</p>

<p>
    If this is not the directory you want to install to, move this script to the target directory before continuing.
